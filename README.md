# Azul for Roblox
Welcome to the GitHub organization for Azul for Roblox! This organization was spawned out of a conflict of vision / loss of faith in the leadership with other open source developers.

## What We've Done
* We've forked all of the repositories from the other open source developers. We will continue to pull in select changes that they make upstream, as well as applying our own patches / fixes wherever necessary.

## What's Next
* We are looking into forming a 501(c)(3) to financially support the Azul organization - similar to an Apache Foundation type situation. Please stay tuned!

XOXO,
